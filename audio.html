  <P>This was a project I made for school where I turned my friends voice into a monster voice. The character he is voicing is a character in one of my games called "natalie vs. the mind" but it didnt make it because we decided to not use audio for our project. In the audio, I did 3 different versions of the monster voice and made it overlap to give the illusion of intrusive thoughts.</P>
