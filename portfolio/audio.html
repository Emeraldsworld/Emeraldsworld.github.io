  <p>This is an audio I made for school and was my first audio project. It is supposed to seem creepy. I made it using Reaper and freesounds.com<a href="activity 7.2.wav" class="button">ambient audio</a></p>
  <P>This was a project about making a story only using sounds. I made it seem creepy and unsettling. I made it using Reaper and freesounds.com <a href="activity 7.3.wav" class="button">sound story</a></P>
  <p>This was a project where I spotted and redesigned audio for gameplay in animal crossing. I used reaper and freesounds.com <a href="activity 7.4.mov" class="button">animal crossing spotting project</a></P>
  <P>This was a project I made for school where I turned my friends voice into a monster voice. The character he is voicing is a character in one of my games called "natalie vs. the mind" but it didnt make it because we decided to not use audio for our project. In the audio, I did 3 different versions of the monster voice and made it overlap to give the illusion of intrusive thoughts.<a href="collapsamonster.wav" class="button">Monster voice</a></P>
